# PhantomX Network 🌌

A next-generation blockchain platform combining AI, multi-device mining, quantum-safe cryptography, and interplanetary networking capabilities.

## 🚀 Features

- **Advanced Blockchain Core**: Custom PoS/hybrid consensus mechanism
- **Multi-Device Mining**: Support for mobile, web, desktop, and IoT devices
- **AI Integration**: Neural mining, security analysis, and smart rewards
- **Quantum-Safe Security**: Post-quantum cryptographic layer
- **Interplanetary Support**: Delay-tolerant networking for space nodes
- **VPN Network**: Decentralized VPN with reward mechanisms
- **Bio-Authentication**: DNA-based wallet derivation (experimental)
- **Neural Mining**: BCI integration for proof-of-focus mining
